audacious minimal crossfade plugin.
-----------------------------------

Copyright Â© 2009 William Pitcock <nenolod@atheme.org>.

Note that this is the crossfading engine only. All other features not related to that
engine are removed, but they were not useful in the scope of audacious anyway.

stuff to do still
-----------------

- player.[ch] can go easily
- finish refactoring config GUI
