psf2 plugin
-----------

What is this?

It's a PSF2 plugin based on:

 * UPSE
 * Audio Overload
 * Highly Experimental

It's under the BSD license, mostly, but it uses code from PeOPS, so it's
probably GPL.

Does it work?

Yes. But there's bugs. See http://audacious-media-player.org/?title=Audacious2/PSF2Plugin 
for suggestions on things you can do.
